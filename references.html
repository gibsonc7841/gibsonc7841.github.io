  <h3>Document Basics</h3>
  <p>Every HTML document has some basic text that needs to be there for it to work.<br>
    To start, you must have the text: &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; - you need this before any HTML so that the browser can recognize the document as an HTML document.<br>
    Next, you must have: &lt;html&gt; - this indicated that the following text is HTML.
    Afterward, you need &lt;body&gt; - the body indicates the actual document that will display on the browser.
  
  <h1>Heading</h1>
  <p>Paragraph</p>
  
  <p>Paragraph that<br>has some<br>line breaks</p>
  
  <p>Here is<hr>a line.</p>

  <h3>Document Basics</h3>
  <p>Every HTML document has some basic text that needs to be there for it to work.<br>
    To start, you must have the text: &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; - you need this before any HTML so that the browser can recognize the document as an HTML document.<br>
    Next, you must have: &lt;html&gt; - this indicated that the following text is HTML.<br>
    If you want the browser tab to display a title, use &lt;title&gt;insert title here&lt;/title&gt;<br>
    Afterward, you can have a header with &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt;<br>
    TO indicate the actual document, you will need to use &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt;</p>
  
  <h3>Headings, Paragraphs, and Breaks</h3>
  <p>To create a heading like the one above, use &lt;h3&gt; and &lt;/h3&gt;
  
  <p>To write paragraphs like these, use &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;</p>
  
  <p>Paragraph that<br>has some<br>line breaks - achieve this by using &lt;br&gt;</p>
  
  <p>Here is<hr>a line - to achieve this, use &lt;hr&gt;</p>
  
  <!-- Here is a comment that no one will ever see... -->
  
  <p>Above this paragraph, there's a hidden comment that is not visible by the browser. If you would like to use comments,
    use &lt;!-- insert comment here --&gt;
    
  <h3>Links and Images</h3>
    
    <p>What are links? <a href="/index">Here's</a> one.</p> To create a link, use the href attribute by doing &lt;a href="insertlinkhere"&gt;linktext&lt;/a&gt;
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="/images/img_girl.jpg" length="50" width="50">
    <br>
    <p>If you want to add images, it is easier to create an images folder on your site, to have local images.
      Then, use &lt;img src="/images/insertimgfile" 
    <p> What are lists? </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Coffee</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Tea</li>
    </ul

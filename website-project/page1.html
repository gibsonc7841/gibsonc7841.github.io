    <h2>Golf's History</h2>
    <p>It is agreed that golf began in the 15th century in Scotland. The players used very primitive clubs to strike a pebble or rock throughout a natural course made up of things like sand dunes or rabbit holes.<img src="/images/his_chole.gif"> More information and a theory can be found<a href=http://www.golfeurope.com/almanac/history/history1.htm> here.</a></p>
    <p>Golf exploded in Scotland. Scotland's misfortune happened to force Scotland to prepare itself for an English invasion of the country. Scotland had neglected its military training as the sports golf and soccer were very popular, causing both sports to be banned in 1457. The ban on the sport was not lifted until 50 years later in 1502 as the Treaty of Glasgow was signed.<img src="/images/1200px-Treaty_of_Union.jpg"> </p>

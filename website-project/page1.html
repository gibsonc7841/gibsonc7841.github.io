    <h2>Golf's History</h2>
    <p>It is agreed that golf began in the 15th century in Scotland. The players used very primitive clubs to strike a pebble or rock throughout a natural course made up of things like sand dunes or rabbit holes.<img src="/images/his_chole.gif"> Obviously, golf has evolved over the few hundred years that it has existed, and natural courses are not even close to the courses of today. We use much more evolved clubs and technique, but that's today. Let's get back to the real history of the sport. More information and a theory can be found<a href=http://www.golfeurope.com/almanac/history/history1.htm> here.</a></p>
    <p>Golf exploded in Scotland. Scotland's misfortune happened to force Scotland to prepare itself for an English invasion of the country. Scotland had neglected its military training as the sports golf and soccer were very popular, causing both sports to be banned in 1457. The ban on the sport was not lifted until 50 years later in 1502 as the Treaty of Glasgow was signed.<img src="/images/1200px-Treaty_of_Union.jpg"> Golf was popularized in England by King Charles I and introduced to the French by Mary Queen of Scots. One interesting fact about this involves the term "caddie." Caddies are typically a person who will carry a player's bag for them, give them club recommendations, and maybe tell them the distance to the hole. The term was pretty much invented by Mary Queen of Scots as helpers in the French military were known as cadets - which is where the word caddie comes from.<img src="/images/mary-queen-of-scotland.jpg"> </p>

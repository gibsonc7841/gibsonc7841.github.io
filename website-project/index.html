    <h2>Golf</h2>
    <p>In simplest terms, golf is a sport where you hit a ball with a stick. The objective of golf is to hit the ball into the hole. With this basic information, one needs to know that the "sticks" are called clubs. Throughout the hole, one must use different clubs, such as the driver, irons, and a putter to eventually have the ball fall into the hole.</p>
    <p>To play golf, one must first understand that golf is played on a course consisting of eighteen total holes, such as the one below.<img src="/images/Aerial-Drone-Video-Photography-Clarksville-TN-3.jpg">Again, in simplest terms, to actually play one must stand over the ball, take a swing with the stick, and end up hitting the ball as the swing is completed.</p>

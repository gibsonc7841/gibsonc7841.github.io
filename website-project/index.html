    <h3>What You Will Learn</h3>
    <p>Golf may seem simple, but with a deeper understanding of the sport one can learn much more and enjoy to play and watch the sport. In just a few minutes, one will be able to learn about the history of the sport, misconceptons, professional play, and the absolute basics on: what is the sport, and how do you play?</p>

    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <p>In simplest terms, golf is a sport where you hit a ball with a stick. The objective of golf is to hit the ball into the hole. With this basic information, one needs to know that the "sticks" are called clubs. Throughout the hole, one must use different clubs, such as the driver, irons, and a putter to eventually have the ball fall into the hole.</p>
    <p>To play golf, one must first understand that golf is played on a course consisting of eighteen total holes, such as the one below.<img src="/images/Aerial-Drone-Video-Photography-Clarksville-TN-3.jpg" width="250" height="150">Again, in simplest terms, to actually play one must stand over the ball, take a swing with the stick, and end up hitting the ball as the swing is completed. Depending on the distance to the hole and the club one is using, the backswing might be a different length. One might full swing, which is where the club is raised all the way to the top of a swing, or one might do a percentage of their full swing, where they only raise it about halfway, or any other fraction. More in depth descriptions of the sport and how to play can be found elsewhere. </p>

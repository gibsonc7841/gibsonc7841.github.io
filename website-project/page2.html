    <h2>Golf's Misconceptions</h2>
    <p>One huge misconception about golf is that the sport takes all day for one to complete. This is false, as you can finish an 18 hole course in just a few hours.<br><img src="/images/5793ca8f006ab-384x384.png" width="200" height="200"></p>
    <p>Another misconception about the sport is that it is very expensive to play. Golf, like other sports or even online games, is as expensive as you want it to be. Of course, there are some necessities that may cost you, but it's not like it costs thousands to play golf or get started.<br><img src="/images/Flying-Dollars-PNG-Clipart.png" width="200" height="194"><br>If one really wishes to spend this much on golf, or any game, then they will, and that is their choice. With educated decisions, a beginner can start golfing for less than $50 at centers dedicated for beginners.</p>
    <p>One last, satirical misconception is that some believe golf isn't a sport. This sounds funny, but it truly isn't. Golfers take the sport very seriously and it can even heavily impact emotions if one does not have control over what they feel. Golf is a sport, and should be used for entertainment but also taken seriously.
